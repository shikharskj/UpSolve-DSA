1 - String sort by default follows lexical sort

2 - It's better to directly generate the required result 
    instead of first generating the sequence ,and then,
    manipulating result out of it.
    (This way we can write better code with less time complexity)
    
3 - Always think of a recursive solution at the back of the mind.
